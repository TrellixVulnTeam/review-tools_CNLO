Some USNs are known to have "allbinaries" with incorrect versions (see
https://launchpad.net/bugs/1841848). As a result, snap-check-notices and
snap-updates-available can't accurately report on these versions. In general
there is no single convention that a binary version must use relative to the
source version. We will create a map using the find-unmatched-bin-versions
script. Eg:

$ cat .../xenial/main/binary-amd64/Packages \
  | find-unmatched-bin-versions xenial > ./xenial

$ cat .../bionic/main/binary-amd64/Packages \
  | find-unmatched-bin-versions bionic > ./bionic

$ cat ./xenial ./bionic > ubuntu-unmatched-bin-versions.json

Then fix up ubuntu-unmatched-bin-versions.json to be valid json. With this
information, the tools can try a few different strategies to match the version.
