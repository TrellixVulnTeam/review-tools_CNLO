Runnable tests:
- click-check-lint: lint tests
- click-check-security: security hook tests
- click-check-desktop: desktop hook tests
- click-run-checks: all tests

Importable tests:
- clickreviews/cr_lint.py: lint tests
- clickreviews/cr_security.py: security hook tests
- clickreviews/cr_desktop.py: desktop hook tests

In general, add or modify tests and report by using:
 self._add_result(<type>, <name>, <message>)

Where <type> is one of 'info', 'warn', 'error'. <name> is the name of the
test (prefixed by <review_type>_), which is set when creating a ClickReview
object. After all tests are run, if there are any errors, the exit status is
'2', if there are no errors but some warnings, the exit status is '1',
otherwise it is '0.

See check-skeleton and cr_skeleton.py for how to create new tests. In short:
 * create a check-<something> and a cr_<something>.py script based off of the
   skeleton
 * modify check-<something> to use cr_<something>.py
 * add tests to cr_<something>.py. If you name the tests 'check_<sometest>'
   ClickReview.do_checks() will enumerate and run them automatically

To run tests, just execute: run-tests
